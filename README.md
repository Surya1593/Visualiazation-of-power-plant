# Visualiazation-of-power-plant

# Objective: 
In the changing energy market conditions, load flexibility becomes more and more a gamechanging factor for conventional power plants. Although todays conventional fleet has not been designed with the focus on flexible operation, intermittent feed-in from renewable energy forces conventional units to adapt their production more frequently, with higher ramp rates and larger amplitudes. In order to improve flexibility of existing units, investigations on their behavior during transient operation is required. However, larger units are critical for the stability of an entire power system and tests during operation are therefore risky. Yet an effective method to investigate and optimize the dynamic behavior of a power plant is to create a digital copy by developing a virtual simulator. The topic of this thesis is the post-processing and visualization of the simulation results in a time-dependend graphical style for presentation purposes and the better understanding by operators. 

# Work Packages:
1. Investigation of possible software (e.g. Inkscape, GIMP, Excel, Matlab, C, …)
2. Determination of an appropriate approach, especially for the interaction between simulation output file and graphics environment
3. Building up component models for all interesting parts of the process
4. Development of graphical indicators for different states, i.e. temperatures, pressures, mass flows, valve openings, filling levels, … 
5. Creation of an easy-to-use connection between simulation file and visualization
